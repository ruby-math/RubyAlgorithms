        <h2>Course description:</h2>

        <p>This course will introduce students to the basic categories of<span class="pslongeditbox"> ancient Israelite and Jewish religion from its origins in the world of the ancient Near East in the second millennium BCE until the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE</span><span>.</span><span
                class="pslongeditbox"> We will critically examine the meaning and history of such categories as "monotheism,&rdquo; &ldquo;scripture,&rdquo;
            and &ldquo;early Judaism.&rdquo; We will also discuss the history of religious institutions, texts, and practices, as well as the dynamics of continuity and change in ancient Israelite and Jewish societies. This course will pay special attention to the complex relationship that exists between history and collective memory as constructed through texts and rituals.</span>
        </p>

        <h3>Course objectives and learning goals:</h3>

        <p>The course is designed to introduce students to the main categories of Judaism in antiquity. It will address

        <h3>Required texts:</h3>

        <p><b></b><b>How this course is organized (schedule and assignments):</b></p>

        <p>This is an online class centered around learning activities due on certain days of the week. You don't want
            to be late, so be sure to become familiar with this weekly pattern right at the beginning of the course.
            This pattern is usually the same every week, but there will be variations, so read the syllabus and weekly
            modules ahead of time.</p>

        <p><b>Regular rhythm of the week, most weeks:</b></p>

        <p>Each week we'll have a new "module" or unit. The activities of the week require you to be involved in the
            course at least four days a week to meet the due dates, so the course is selfpaced only in the sense that
            you don't need to be in a class on a certain day or certain time, but you do need to meet the weekly due
            dates, especially for posting comments to the Discussion Board and submitting the essays. You'll notice that
            the rhythm builds from activity to activity. You need to work through both the video lecturettes and the
            readings. They provide the material on which you post to the Discussion Board, and the summary activities of
            the Quiz and/or Essay give you a chance to consolidate and evaluate your knowledge.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;<b>The Rhythm:</b></p>

        <p>Note that the following is a general pattern. Some weeks you will be required to post at least twice, once
            for your first original contribution and then again to respond to your classmates.</p>

        <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #cf2a27;">COMPLETE BY SUNDAY:</span> </strong>Read
            the instructor&rsquo;s introduction to the week&rsquo;s topic</p>

        <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><strong><span style="color: #cf2a27;">COMPLETE BY WEDNESDAY</span></strong>: </span>Readings
            and lecturettes. You will encounter two kinds of readings in this course: (a) Primary source materials from
            the time periods discussed in the course and (b) "Secondary" writings about the history of Judaism by modern
            scholars. Most of your secondary readings will come from the textbook. You will also be asked to take a quiz
            every week, except for the weeks on which a midterm and the final are due.</p>

        <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #cf2a27;">COMPLETE BY THURSDAY:</span> </strong>Make
            initial posts to Discussion Board. You will have specific questions to reply to and guide you through the
            writing of your initial posts.</p>

        <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #cf2a27;"><strong>COMPLETE BY SATURDAY: </strong></span>Read
            and respond to the posts of at least two of your classmates.</p>

        <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #2b78e4;"><strong>WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOUR
            WEEK:</strong> </span>The organization of each Module is such that you will be reading texts and absorbing
            the lecturettes in the first part of the week and participating more actively during the second part of the
            week, aka THE WEEKEND!</p>

        <p><b>Note on Work Load:</b></p>

        <p>DePaul&rsquo;s formula for student workload in a course is a minimum of 2 hours of preparation for each hour
            of class time if you wish to earn an average grade. The normal class meets 6 hours a week, so the workload
            has been designed so that it can be completed in 12 hours a week. Remember that the average grade is C, so
            that if you wish to achieve a higher grade you&rsquo;ll have to put in more than the minimum of 12 hours a
            week.</p>

        <p><b></b><b>Course requirements:</b></p>

        <p>Final grades will be based on the following breakdown:</p>

        <p><span>Five weekly quizzes &ndash; 40 % (8 % each)</span></p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>Three three-page papers &ndash; 30 % (10 % each)</li>
            <li>The final &ndash; 15 %</li>
            <li>Two posts and weekly discussions &ndash; 10 % (5 % each)</li>
            <li>Participation grade &ndash; 5 % &nbsp;</li>
        </ol>
        <p><span>All assignments must be completed to receive a passing grade for the course. Letter grades have the following meaning: A &ndash;
            creative contribution beyond what was given in class, presuming that the contribution is accurate and intelligent; B &ndash;
            accurate and complete grasp of the material covered (i.e., complete on matters of central importance not exhaustive in detail) but without creative contribution; C &ndash;
            adequate, correct but not complete; D &ndash; close, but not correct or adequate; F &ndash;
            not even close.</span></p>

        <p>&nbsp;<span>Grading scale for this class will be as follows:</span></p>

        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
            <span></span><span>A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 94-100 %</span><span><br/></span><span>A- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 90-93</span><br/><span>B+ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 87-89</span><br/><span>B &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 84-86</span><br/><span>B- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 80-83</span><br/><span>C+ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 78-79</span><br/><span>C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 76-77</span><br/><span>C- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 73-75</span><br/><span>D+ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 70-72</span><br/><span>D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 67-69</span><br/><span>F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0-66%</span><span>&nbsp;</span>
        </p>

        <p><b>The Weekly Quizzes</b></p>

        <p>The weekly quizzes help you to assess your knowledge but they are also a learning tool. The quizzes are
            graded, each quiz being worth 8 % of your final grade. Questions from the quizzes are also used as part of
            the final, which is another good reason to get them right during the Module. All of the quizzes have 20
            questions.</p>

        <p>You will be allowed two attempts to take a quiz. The highest score will be posted in D2L.</p>

        <p>To view your quiz attempts when studying for the mid-term or final:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click on &ldquo;Quizzes&rdquo; on the far right of the blue navigation bar.</li>
            <li>Select the quiz you would like to review by clicking on the quiz title (i.e. &ldquo;Quiz 3&rdquo;)</li>
            <li>Select &ldquo;Submissions&rdquo;</li>
            <li>Select &ldquo;Attempt 1&rdquo; to view your quiz responses</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This view allows you to see all the questions, all the possible answers, the answer you selected, and whether
            or not you received credit for that answer.</p>

        <p><b></b><b>The Final</b></p>

        <p>Final examination will cover all five weeks of the course. Students will be expected to demonstrate, both a
            wide mastery of the contents of the lectures and course materials, and the ability to think critically about
            issues raised by the course.</p>

        <p>You will be allowed two attempts on the final. The highest score will be posted in D2L.</p>

        <p><b>Three three-page papers</b></p>

        <p>You will be required to hand in three short papers (three typed pages each) related to three topics covered
            in the course. Guidelines for these papers will be posted on D2L. Each paper will count for 10% of your
            grade for the course, and must be handed in on time. Late submission will result in 50% reduction of your
            grade (A will go down to C, etc). In these papers you have to demonstrate critical approach to both primary
            and secondary texts, as well as the ability to see them in specific historical and cultural settings. You
            must learn the difference between the documented use of the work of others, and copying or plagiarism.
            Plagiarism will not be tolerated under any circumstances. This course adheres to the University&rsquo;s
            policies on plagiarism as stated in the current Bulletin/Student Handbook. Consult the manual &ldquo;Writing
            in Liberal Studies,&rdquo; for instruction on proper citation or acknowledgment of the work of others in
            class assignments.</p>

        <p><b>Posts and discussions:</b></p>

        <p>Each week, with the exception of three weeks in which papers are due, you will be asked to make posts and
            participate in on-line discussions. In your posts you&rsquo;ll have to address specific questions provided
            by me for this week. Initial posts will be due by 11:50 PM on Thursdays.</p>

        <p>By 11:50 PM on Saturday of the same week you should post responses, reactions, and comments to your
            classmates&rsquo; posts. A single post, even if high quality, will not suffice. The idea of an online course
            is to create a virtual community. If you are not reading and responding to the posts of your classmates, you
            are not contributing to this community.</p>

        <p>I will post my comments on your initial posts and responses to these posts by 11:50 PM on Sunday. These
            comments are important. Some of the questions on midterm and final will be based on my weekly comments.</p>

        <p>Posting is one of the most important activities in an online course. <b>In an online course, it is the
            primary way that I know you are out there and doing the work in a serious manner. </b>(Please read that
            sentence again!) I use posting to assess your involvement in the<b> </b>course, your mastery of content, and
            your application of critical thinking to the material. Of<b> </b>course, posting is an opportunity for you
            to share personal responses to the course material,<b> </b>and these responses are welcome. But the ideal
            post combines personal responses with<b> </b>an indication of deep engagement with the material and
            thoughtful insights. <b>Every post is graded </b>on a four point scale, and you can see these grades in &gt;My
            Grades along with your other course grades.</p>

        <p>Please be careful about<b> </b>plagiarism even in your posts. When you are asked to comment on an idea or a
            text and you<b> </b>"borrow" a concept from an internet source to help you in this task without citing it,
            this is<b> </b>plagiarism. If you are asked to analyze something using the materials from the lecturettes
            and<b> </b>textbooks and you bypass these by getting something from the internet, you have failed to
            do<b> </b>the assignment as well as plagiarized. And of course if you respond to such a post without<b> </b>specific
            references to the readings and the lecturettes, you'll earn a poor grade because you<b> </b>haven't
            fulfilled the assignment. After the deadline your grade is zero for the post.</p>

        <p>Your posts and discussions for each week will be graded based on the following criteria:</p>

        <p><b>A Discussion (4 points): Distinguished or Outstanding </b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>are made in time for others to read and respond</li>
            <li>deliver information that is full of thought, insight, and analysis</li>
            <li>make connections to previous or current content or to real-life situations</li>
            <li>contain rich and fully developed new ideas, connections, or applications</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>B Discussion (3 points): Proficient</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>are made in time for others to read and respond</li>
            <li>deliver information that shows that thought, insight, and analysis have taken place</li>
            <li>make connections to previous or current content or to real-life situations, but the connections are not
                really clear or are too obvious
            </li>
            <li>contain new ideas, connections, or applications, but they may lack depth or detail<span>&nbsp;</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>C Discussion (2 points): Basic </b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>may not be posted in time for others to read and respond</li>
            <li>are generally competent, but the actual information they deliver seems thin and commonplace</li>
            <li>make limited, if any, connections, and those are often cast in the form of vague generalities</li>
            <li>contain few, if any, new ideas or applications; often are a rehashing or summary of other comments<span>&nbsp;</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>D Discussion (1 point): Below Expectations </b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>may not be posted in time for others to read and respond</li>
            <li>are rudimentary and superficial; without evidence of insight or analysis</li>
            <li>does not contribute new ideas, connections, or applications</li>
            <li>may be completely off topic&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>F Discussion (0 points): No Participation</b></p>

        <p><b>Communication: </b>Students are encouraged to post their questions on D2L.<b> </b>If you need to
            communicate with me directly, email is the preferred method of communication in online courses (as well as
            in the professional world) because it provides a record of messages we send to each other. Students in this
            course are expected to check their email every day. If I send you an individual email (as opposed to an
            email blast to the entire class) I expect the response within two days. If you are unresponsive to emails
            your participation grade will be lowered.</p>

                        address the following questions in your initial post: Does the term &ldquo;monotheism&rdquo;
                        offer a helpful category do describe the religion of ancient Israel? Why? What role did Josiah&rsquo;s

                        support your argument. Read and respond to the posts of your classmates.</p>

                        wake of the Restoration. </b>Based on Ezra 7-10 and Ruth 1-4, this week&rsquo;s readings and
                        lectures address the following questions in your initial post: Who was Ezra? What were the
                        sources of his authority? What are the main principles on which the identity of Jewish community
                        is constructed in Ezra 7-10? How does the story told in the book of Ruth challenge some of these
                        principles?<b></b></p>

                        in careful analysis of document&rsquo;s text. You should cite specific passages from the text to
                        support your argument. Read and respond to the posts of your classmates.</p>
